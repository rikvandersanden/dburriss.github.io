In [Part 1](/honest-arguments) we looked at ways of making your code more descriptive by using custom types instead of simple types like `string`. In this article we will look at what your return type can tell you about a method.

# Honest Return Types

For most of this post let us build on the example of a `Person` repository. We are not going to dive into implementation but instead focus on the descriptiveness of the return type. Our starting point is this:

```csharp
public interface IQueryPerson
{
    Person Get(Email email);
}
```

The return type should be honest about what can happen when you call a method. Does this repository method return `null` if no record is found? Does it throw and exception? Does it return a [special case](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/specialCase.html) subtype? Wouldn't it be nice if your return type could tell you this instead of you having to dig into the implementation to find out.

My 2 criteria are:

1. A return type should be really descriptive of what the possible outcomes are
2. The interface for interacting with a type should make it difficult for developers to do the wrong thing


## Result: A first try

One solution is a `Result<T>` or some such flavour. It might look something like this:

```csharp
public class Result<T>
{
    public T Value { get; set; }
    public bool IsSuccess { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<string> Errors { get; set; }
    public Result()
    {
        Errors = new List<string>();
    }

    public Result(T value)
    {
        if(value == null)
        {
            IsSuccess = false;
        }
        else
        {
            IsSuccess = true;
            Value = value;
        }
    }
}
```

This could be written in slightly different ways, with error codes instead of string for Errors, or even `Exception`. Let's discuss the pros and cons of this.

### Pros

* It does acknowledge that something could go wrong
* Can return some error and state information without throwing an exception (read unexplicit `goto` statement)

### Cons

* It is not descriptive about what represents a failure
* Value can be accessed without checking for success
* The type doesn't convey whether `null` could still be a valid value

So it is something but doesn't really fulfill either of my criteria very well. We are going to have to take a quick sidebar and talk about representing `null`. `Result<T>` doesn't tell us whether we should expect `T` to be `null` and whether that is valid.

## Option: `null` is None

"It depends" is something you hear a lot in development, and wouldn't it be great if a type conveyed this? `Option` or `Maybe` are types often found in more functional languages that highlight the fact that a value could not be present. It allows you to say that there is `Some` value, or the value is `None`. This is probably easier to demonstrate...

> I am using [LanguageExt](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext) to get some more functional types. This one is mature and fully featured but pick whatever works for you.

```csharp
public Option<Person> Get(Email email)
{
    Person person = QueryByEmail(email);//person could be null if no matching email found in the datasource
    return person;
}

//usage example
var person1 = personRepository.Get(email);

//print out last name if person was found otherwise print "Nobody"
person1.Match(
    Some: p => Console.WriteLine(p.LastName),
    None: () => Console.WriteLine("Nobody")
);

//return fullname or Nobody if no one was found
var person1Name = person1.Match(
    Some: p => $"{p.FirstNames} {p.LastName}",
    None: () => "Nobody"
);
```

The implementation uses `implicit` conversion to return `None` if the value is `null` otherwise the `Person` is elevated with Some.  
I explicitly elevate the result to demonstrate what is happening. Let's also add some error-handling as this will show a problem.

```csharp
using static LanguageExt.Prelude;
public Option<Person> Get(Email email)
{
    try
    {
        Person person = QueryByEmail(email);
        if(person == null)
            return None;
        return Some(person);
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        return None;
    }
}
```

So this is looking a little better.

### Pros

* Return type is explicit about possibility of no value being returned
* The API of the type encourages handling of branch between happy and unhappy path

### Cons

* We cannot differentiate between no value and an exception

## Exception: return don't throw

> The following `Exceptional<T>` and `Validation<T>` types are defined in [HonestTypes](https://github.com/dburriss/HonestTypes). Check the project page for installation instructions.

So our type needs to be a bit more explicit about what can happen. Let's introduce an `Exceptional<T>` type. 
This is similar to `Option<Person>` but instead of **Some** and **None** it has **Exception** and **Success**.  
For those of you familiar with functional programming it is basically `Either<Exception, T>` with left set to `Exception`.

```csharp
public Exceptional<Option<Person>> Get(Email email)
{
    try
    {
        Person person = QueryByEmail(email);
        Option<Person> result = person;
        return result;
    }
    catch (DbException ex)//only catch expected exceptions
    {
        return ex;
    }
}

//usage
var person1 = personRepository.Get(email);

person1.Match(
    Exception: ex => Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}"),
    Success: opt => opt.Match(
        None: () => Console.WriteLine("Person: Nobody"),
        Some: p => Console.WriteLine($"Person: {p.FirstNames} {p.LastName}")
    )
);
```

One important point in the repository implementation is you need to assign it to `Option<Person>` before returning it which implicitly converts to `Exceptional<Option<Person>>`. 
You can't go directly from `Person` to `Exceptional<Option<Person>>` unfortunately.  

The difference in this implementation is in the exception handling. See how we just return the exception? The exception has an implicit conversion to the elevated type of `Exceptional<T>`.

### Pros

* Return type is very explicit about both errors and no value
* API of return type encourages good handling of code paths

### Cons

* With the nested generics the type declaration is quite verbose

## Conclusion

So with a bit of borrowing from functional programming and some added verbosity to our method signature we managed to move from an admittedly simple signature to a slightly more verbose one that is brutally honest about the possible outcomes.

```csharp
Person Get(Email email);
Result<Person> Get(Email email);
Option<Person> Get(Email email);
Exceptional<Option<Person>> Get(Email email);
```

I hope you found something useful in this and if you did I cannot recommend enough the brilliant [Functional Programming in C#](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp) from Manning. I must warn that some of the chapters in this book are heavy going. Not because they are badly written but because as a C# and Java developer the concepts are so foreign that they take a while to sink in. Like most things worthwhile it takes effort and determination but you will be a better developer for it.

## Extra

There are times when valid errors can occur but this are not exceptional. Validation is a common example of this and where a validation result is often the go to type. Wouldn't it be nice if we could apply the same pattern as with exceptions?

```csharp
using static F;

public Validation<Person> Validate(Person person)
{
    if (person == null)
        return Error("Person is null");

    //collect all errors
    return Valid(person)
        .Apply(ValidateFirstNames(person))
        .Apply(ValidateLastName(person))
        .Apply(ValidateEmail(person));

    //short circuit on error
    return Valid(person)
        .Bind(ValidateFirstNames)
        .Bind(ValidateLastName)
        .Bind(ValidateEmail);
}

private Validation<Person> ValidateFirstNames(Person person)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(person.FirstNames))
        return Invalid(Error($"{nameof(person.FirstNames)} cannot be empty"));

    return person;
}

private Validation<Person> ValidateLastName(Person person)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(person.LastName))
        return Invalid(Error($"{nameof(person.LastName)} cannot be empty"));

    return person;
}

private Validation<Person> ValidateEmail(Person person)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace((string)person.Email))
        return Invalid(Error($"{nameof(person.Email)} cannot be empty"));

    return person;
}

//usage
var validatedPerson = service.Validate(person);

validatedPerson.Match(
    Valid: p => Console.WriteLine($"{p.LastName}, {p.FirstNames} <{p.Email}>"),
    Invalid: err => err.ToList().ForEach(x => Console.WriteLine(x.Message))
);
```

I added 2 flavours. The first uses `Apply` and is applicative so all errors are returned. The second uses `Bind` and short-circuits on the first error.

And there you have some neat validation logic. If you have any comments or suggestions please leave them below. If you found this useful, please share it with someone who you think might also find it useful.
